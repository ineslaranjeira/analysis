# Analysis code for IBL data

Code for analysing IBL data. See https://github.com/int-brain-lab/ibllib for instructions of how to access the data (through ONE) and metadata (through Alyx). 

You must create a define_paths.py file once in the python folder with the following content:
```
def fig_path():
  path = 'put/your/path/here'
  return path
```
